💼 Heart Attack & Housing Price Prediction Models
Welcome!
This repository features two real-world machine learning projects:

🫀 Heart Attack Prediction – A model that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on clinical data.

🏠 Housing Price Prediction – A model that estimates house prices based on property features.

These projects are designed to showcase my end-to-end data science skills, from data preprocessing and model building to evaluation and visualization.

🚀 Projects Overview
🫀 Heart Attack Prediction Model
Goal: Predict the risk of heart attack based on patient data.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Techniques:

Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression)

Feature importance analysis

Evaluation via ROC-AUC, Accuracy, F1-score

Outcome: A user-friendly, balanced model to support early diagnosis.

🏠 Housing Price Prediction Model
Goal: Predict accurate housing prices in various locations.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, , Matplotlib,seaborn

Key Techniques:

Regression models (Linear regression)

Feature engineering + outlier treatment

Evaluation via RMSE, MAE,MSE, R²

Outcome: A reliable price estimator for real estate decision-making.
